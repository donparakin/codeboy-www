I'm about to start a new project using
[Python](https://www.python.org/), 
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/),
and [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/).

This means I'll probably be discovering a few new things
and solving a few interesting problems.

Things and problems that might be worth documenting.
For my future self, for other humans,
but probably just for a gaggle of AI/LLM bots.

Documenting by blogging?
Sure, why not! Blogging can't be *that* hard.
